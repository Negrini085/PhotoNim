This section of the documentation delves into the source code of the PhotoNim raytracer, providing a detailed explanation.
First, we will examine the tools developed for creating a functional raytracer, specifically the geometric elements grouped within the ```geometry.nim``` module. 
Following this, we'll delve into elements unique to raytracing, such as the camera and ray usage, detailed in the ```camera.nim``` source file.
Additionally, we will cover the random number generator found in the ```pcg.nim``` source file, which is crucial in order to solve the rendering equation.
